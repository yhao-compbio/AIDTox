## Introduction 

While our previous work [DTox](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/DTox) greatly improved the interpretability of toxicity prediction, it bears some limitations in the current form. For instance, the input feature profile of DTox that contains 361 target proteins is inferred from structure-based binding prediction models, which were trained on compound-target interaction datasets. As a result, some target proteins were excluded from the input feature profile of DTox if binding to these proteins cannot be well predicted from structure properties of compounds, or the number of available samples is insufficient for model construction. Fortunately, the recent development of a toxicology-focused graph database named ComptoxAI provides extensive knowledge on relations among chemicals and genes, thus may address the current limitation of DTox. In this study, we introduced an enhanced version of DTox, namely AIDTox, for integrating chemical-gene connections from ComptoxAI into toxicity prediction. We demonstrate that AIDTox expanded the original feature space of DTox by three folds, with significant supplement to target categories such as transporters, ion channels, cytochrome P450 enzymes. These target proteins play critical roles in drug metabolism and elimination, thus become a valuable asset for predicting and explaining the cytotoxic outcomes of drugs. We conclude that AIDTox can provide a comprehensive interpretation of drug-induced cellular activities leading to toxicity.
