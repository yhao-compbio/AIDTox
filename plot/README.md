+ First, line charts were adpoted to visualize the relationship between training performance (y-axis) and the number of top predictive gene features (x-axis) in two datasets: [HEK293 cytotoxicity](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/feature_number_comparison/compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation_feature_number_training_loss_comparison_linechart_tox21-rt-viability-hek293-p1.pdf) and [HepG2 cytotoxicity](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/feature_number_comparison/compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation_feature_number_training_loss_comparison_linechart_tox21-rt-viability-hepg2-p1.pdf). Training performance is visualized by the binary cross entropy loss (BCE loss) for models derived from three types of chemical-gene connections: binding (blue line), expression (orange line), and hybrid (green line). 

+ Next, barplots were adpoted to visualize the comparison of validation performance across three connection types in two datasets: [HEK293 cytotoxicity](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/connect_type_comparison/compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation_connect_type_testing_performance_comparison_barplot_tox21-rt-viability-hek293-p1.pdf) and [HepG2 cytotoxicity](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/connect_type_comparison/compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation_connect_type_testing_performance_comparison_barplot_tox21-rt-viability-hepg2-p1.pdf). Performance is measured by three metrics: area under ROC curve, balanced accuracy, and F1 score, with error bar showing the 95% confidence interval. 

+ Then, barplots were adpoted to visualize the comparison of validation performance across four models in two datasets: [HEK293 cytotoxicity](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/model_comparison/compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_model_testing_performance_comparison_barplot_tox21-rt-viability-hek293-p1.pdf) and [HepG2 cytotoxicity](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/model_comparison/compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_model_testing_performance_comparison_barplot_tox21-rt-viability-hepg2-p1.pdf). Three other models are considered: (i) our previous DTox model with inferred target profile as input, (ii) QSAR model by random forest with chemical fingerprint as input, and (iii) QSAR model by gradient boosting with chemical fingerprint as input.

+ Finally, radar plots were adopted to visualize the [comparison of gene category distributions](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/binding_protein_class/DTox_AIDTox_feature_space_protein_class_compare_radarchart.pdf) among the features of DTox (blue solid line) and AIDTox (red solid lind), and the [comparison of enzyme subcategory distributions](compound_select_gene_comptoxai_tox21_implementation/binding_protein_class/DTox_AIDTox_feature_space_enzyme_subclass_compare_radarchart.pdf) among the features of DTox (blue solid line) and AIDTox (red solid line). The grey dashed line shows the hypothetical of a proportionate increase from DTox to AIDTox.
